      <ul>
        <li>Use a clean layout with adequate white space</li>

      <p>ID cards are more than just badges – they’re essential for identity, security, and professionalism.</p>
      <p><strong>Key elements in ID card design:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Minimal, readable layout with employee name and designation</li>
        <li>Clear photo placement with proper dimensions</li>
        <li>Use of QR codes or barcodes for scanning</li>
        <li>Security features like holograms, microtext, or UV elements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Choose the right card material – PVC, smart cards, or contactless RFID – depending on your security needs. Lamination and rounded corners improve durability and comfort.</p>
